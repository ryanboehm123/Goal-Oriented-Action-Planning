# Goal-Oriented Behaviors

Goal-Oriented Behavior (GOB) is an AI technique that is used to determine how a character should act and behave based on the goals of the character and their current mood. In many games like the Sims, this technique is incredibly helpful because it allows for a character to have multiple different actions they can take. Our job as the programmer is to determine what action best suits the character at a given time.

## Why are Goal-Oriented Behaviors useful?

GOBs allow characters to behave in specific ways that correlate to how they feel or what would most benefit them. For example, let's say we have a character whose favorite sports team just lost. This character would be sad and we can use GOB to have them act sad, such as placing a rain cloud above their head and have them move around slouching over. As another example, let's say one of our characters needs to go shopping at a specific time. We can have a GOB setup to have them act normally, but the moment that time comes, they head to the store.

We can also combine these two scenarios. Let's say this character needs to go to the store but they are also sad. The GOB will determin how they act. If they are too sad to go to the store, they might choose to not go despite the fact that they made plans to go. If they end up going to the store anyway, they might still act sad while at the store.

GOBs allow for characters to have multiple goals and behaviors and iterate between them to determine what goals are most beneficial to them, what goals are possible for them to do, or how they should act based on how they feel.
